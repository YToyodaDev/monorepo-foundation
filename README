Git Commit

2. Create apps

- WEB & API
  clean up unnesesarry default styles.
  remove the git default directory from api
  set web port to 3001
  update api/dev command to 'dev'

NOTE: The following settings has to be present globally or workspace, or pnpm cannot locate local module within the workspace.

.npmrc file at root dirctory or at ~/ (where Desktop,Documents, Downloads, etc are located)

link-workspace-packages = true
prefer-workspace-packages = true
recursive-install = true

Move apps/api/.prettierrc to the root.(You only want to have one prettier config file in the workspace (personal preference )

# Conflict (personal choice )

.prettierrc

{"semi": false}

This above code will remove semi ';', which conflicts eslint config. If the warns arise, insert the following rule to .eslintrc.js or any eslint config file.

'prettier/prettier': 'off',

I would prefer to have semi because it imo makes it easier to scan code.
